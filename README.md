### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Lawrence (Larry) and I am a Physics, Math, and Chemistry student at the University of Toronto who is seeking Software Engineering Positions for Part Time in September 2022 and Full Time in May 2023.

Iâ€™m currently working at Promise Robotics developing software (Python, Django, Docker, Open CASCADE, IfcOpenShell, Databases), robotics, and CAD to create affordable and sustainable automated construction with applied Physics and machine learning. I am part of an organization called Blue Sky Solar Racing in which I am a senior strategist that conducts solar cell research (optics and bifacial cells), fabrication, and creates simulations (Matlab, Python, Parallel Computing & CAD) to optimize the performance and design of a solar powered car, to be raced in the American and World Solar Competition. The simulations are compiled into a centralized StratApp that my team created as a standalone app for future car generations. I also worked on creating a friend making webapp called Amigos using Java, Javascript, CSS, and HTML. Additionally, I am part of the optics team of the University of Toronto Aerospace Team Space System Division where I do numerical analysis (Python) and research for optics (holographic gratings) of our satellite payload.

Having such broad interests and passion has allowed me to build valuable problem-solving and learning skills that gives me the ability to pick up new concepts with ease. People also are the backbone of my happiness in life thus I am always interested to have a chat anytime. :)

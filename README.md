### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Please feel free to check out my personal website: https://lawrencetsai.me/

My name is Lawrence (Larry) and I am a student at the University of Toronto specializing in Mathematics with minors in Computer Science and Chemistry who is seeking Software Engineering Positions for Part Time in September 2022 and Full Time in May 2023

Iâ€™m currently working at Promise Robotics developing software (Python, Django, Docker, Open CASCADE, IfcOpenShell, Databases), robotics, and CAD to create affordable and sustainable automated construction with applied Physics and machine learning. I work with full-stack development and code review for the API with the sequencing, database and security. I am also part of an organization called Blue Sky Solar Racing in which I am a senior strategist that conducts solar cell research (optics and bifacial cells), fabrication, and creates simulations (Matlab, Python, Parallel Computing & CAD) to optimize the performance and design of a solar powered car, to be raced in the American and World Solar Competition. The simulations are compiled into a centralized StratApp that my team created as a standalone app for future car generations. Some projects of mine include a webcam diagnostic tool in coordination with Dr. Etienne Benard-Seguin and Jeremy Moreau (University of Calgary) to diagnose strabismus using OpenCV and mediapipe. Repo: https://github.com/lt77777/Quick-Ocular-Movements-Detection Another project of mine that I developed was a friend-making webapp called Amigos using Java, Spring Framework, Javascript, CSS, and HTML which was deployed onto Azure. Repo: https://github.com/lt77777/Amigos-App Additionally, I am part of the optics team of the University of Toronto Aerospace Team Space System Division where I do numerical analysis (Python) and research for optics (holographic gratings) of our satellite payload. Additionally, I am leading a team of 2 to design tests for our optical bench prototype which is going to be part of a hyperspectral imaging CubeSat to measure anthropogenic gas emissions across Ontario, Canada in 2024. Repo: https://github.com/spacesys-finch 

Having such broad interests and passion has allowed me to build valuable problem-solving and learning skills that gives me the ability to pick up new concepts with ease. People also are the backbone of my happiness in life thus I am always interested to have a chat anytime. :)

Again, feel free to check out my website: https://lawrencetsai.me/, along with my projects below, and my resume/cover letter.
